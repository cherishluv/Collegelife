# My Experience @ GNDEC

## Day 1

My first day at GNDEC started with all the CSE and IT students assembling in the auditorium. The atmosphere was calm, and the stage was beautifully decorated. After waiting for about 30 minutes, the host invited the first speaker, Harpreet Mam. Her lecture made us feel like we were already a part of the GNDEC family.

Our Principal Sir then motivated us to make the best use of this platform. The NSET Director introduced us to the illustrious history of this institution, emphasizing its 100 years of shaping brilliant minds. He highlighted the first 36 years, which were dedicated to establishing the institute.

## Day 2

A new opportunity arose thanks to Dr. Arvind Dhingra. He helped me shed my reserved behavior and start interacting with others. He asked for 11 boys and 11 girls to come up on stage. Determined not to miss any opportunity, I joined them. We played a team strategy game and introduced ourselves to our peers.

Then, Dr. H.S. Rai, the Controller of Examination, spoke. His perspective on examinations was fascinating, viewing them as opportunities to shine.

Unexpectedly, Dr. H.S. Rai sought 10 students to work with him â€“ not for him. I felt it was divine intervention when I got selected to be part of this group, which eventually grew to 50 members. From the second day of college, we began learning the latest technologies, an opportunity rarely seen elsewhere.

## Day 3

We learned Excel and ChatGPT in an exciting, hands-on class workshop organized by the Causmic Club. Instead of making a normal Excel sheet and performing calculations manually, we tried to do it with commands. I enjoyed it so much that I gave a video feedback after the lecture.

One of the most significant milestones today was being officially appointed as the first leader of my group. This role is a recognition of my skills and dedication, and it provides a valuable opportunity to develop project management and team leadership skills. Leading a group of talented peers and coordinating with the other five leaders appointed in our team has been a rewarding experience.
